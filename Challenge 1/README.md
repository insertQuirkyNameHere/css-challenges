## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

- Allowed me to revisit CSS basics
- Revisited reset CSS
- Worked with images
- Allowed me a chance to work with the position property again

**Here is how to vertically center a div**


```css
.verically-centered-div{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    -ms-transform: translateY(-50%);
    transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to continue practicing CSS flexbox and experimenting with CSS positions till I am fully comfortable with them.
- Am currently working on React and would love to revisit this and code it out using React components

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - My goto reference for CSS flex. Concepts are clearly explained with neat examples and diagrams that aid comprehension.
