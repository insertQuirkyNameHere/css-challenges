You are correct. Radio buttons are the right choice, nothing else makes sense.
You can google accessibly styling radio buttons. But essentially you'll want to accessibly hide the actual input itself, and then style the label to look how you want

@Alex Marshall Thank you for your help. I didn't think about hiding the actual input and styling the label.
However doesn't this raise the issue of actually checking a radio button? How would I have to approach that? Maybe have a click event on the labels and use JS to select the corresponding button?

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator to handle that, and allow styling of the label belonging to the input that is checked
You don't need JS for this, you'll only need it to display the actual rating selected after the form is submitted
